It tends to peak around April 22 or 23.</p> <p>The best time to see shooting stars from the Lyrids is after nightfall and before dawn, weather permitting, of course</p> <p>Dust From Comet Thatcher<br/>The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher, which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun.</p> <p>Where Can I See the Lyrids?<br/>Considered to be the oldest known meteor shower, the Lyrids are named after constellation Lyra. The radiant point of the shower, the point in the sky where the meteors seem to emerge from, lies near the star Vega, one of the brightest stars in the sky during this time of the year.</p> <p>While people in the Northern Hemisphere are best located to view the Lyrids, those in the mid-Southern Hemisphere latitudes can also see the shower between midnight and dawn.</p> <p>Astronomers suggest looking up towards the east to see shooting stars from the Lyrids, the table below shows the exact direction of the Lyrids from your location.</p> <p>Location in the Sky<br/>The Lyrids meteor shower is not visible tonight. Maximum for the shower is on Sunday, April 22, 2018 at 2:22 pm; the table below is for that night:</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>tent and provisions for as long as you plan to stay.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>As with most of our camping trip you can pick and chose which days/nights you wish to join us based on your schedule. Therefore it's not required you stay the entire two days, if you're only able to stay for one. One day with us will feel like 3 or 4 anyhow, so whatever you can endure. :)</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Columbus-Food-Culture-and-Fun/events/246376850/","visibility":"public_limited","group":{"created":1367722099000,"name":"Columbus Food, Culture, and Fun!","id":8348602,"join_mode":"approval","lat":40,"lon":-83.06999969482422,"urlname":"Columbus-Food-Culture-and-Fun","who":"Members","localized_location":"Columbus, OH","region":"en_US"},"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":14400000,"time":1525554000000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"name":"CFCF 5th Anniversary","id":"246376850"},{"created":1520352892000,"duration":25200000,"id":"248470205","name":"Paddle the Kokosing","status":"upcoming","time":1525528800000,"local_date":"2018-05-05","local_time":"10:00","updated":1523385688000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"group":{"created":1360127908000,"name":"The Ohio River Rat Society","id":7054152,"join_mode":"approval","lat":40.08000183105469,"lon":-82.94000244140625,"urlname":"theohioriverratsociety","who":"River Rats","localized_location":"Columbus, OH","region":"en_US"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/theohioriverratsociety/events/248470205/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Hey gang, I know most of you/us will not want to paddle the Marietta event due to the length of the paddle, portaging other logistics, so David thought it a good idea to post something for all others.

Join kayaking friends for the best view of the Scioto Mile &amp; river area. We'll meet at the Put-In of Scioto Audubon. To get here, follow the signs marked on pics. Let's try to have yaks put in and ready to leave at 3.</p> <p>Let's take a stop at a local Restaurant just off the water, Milestone 229. The place features view of the Bicentennial Park fountains plus a place to secure kayaks (bike racks - Parks &amp; Rec approved). We'll see how everyone is doing on a lazy Sunday Summer afternoon and stay a bit longer for a meal or just dessert / appetizer.</p> <p>Some of the foods and beverages at Milestone 229 in Photos:<br/>- Chocolate Cake with Milk<br/>- 3 Little Pigs Sandwich<br/>- Cucumber Lemonade<br/>- Pecan Pie Bread Pudding<br/>- Cookies Cream Dessert Some need to knows on the outing</p> <p>There's no dock on the Scioto Mile but there are several access points (as shown). One is just a 1 minute portage to the restaurant adjacent to the relaxing outdoor fountain. The restaurant opens at 4pm so moving the start time from 2pm to 3. That restaurant has the only fountain view and easiest to secure kayaks tho I make no guarantees about equipment security. That said, tips here should provide plenty of safety for trip necessities. Had no issues at the Arts Festival on the same route; local restaurant is in nearby view of safe keeping place. Either padlock or sit on the patio in plain view if preferred.</p> <p>Scioto Audubon Park has only 15 Parking Spots near the Dock. If full, Park at the Ranger Station across the street from entrance. Walk in and notify Ranger behind glass booth that you're parking there &amp; follow instructions (vehicle license plate). [I make no guarantees you'll not be towed regardless.]</p> <p>Everyone is on Facebook, that's true. I've heard the complaints about the new Meetup format and some troubles with meetup messaging.

During this course, you will learn concepts like variables, data types, functions, if/then statements, arrays and loops. By the end of the course, you will understand how PHP code and a MySQL database can be used to create a dynamic, database-driven website.</p> <p>In this class, we will provide you with some of the basics of programming, teach you to use PHP to manipulate websites, and start you on the path to becoming a great web developer.</p> <p>Understanding the basics of programming, while helpful, is not required. This is an introductory course and will cover the basics, but the focus will be on programming specifically in PHP. Due to the focus on practical PHP, some broader topics around general programming may not be covered in detail. Concepts will be reinforced through hands on, in-class exercises.</p> <p>This class will be taught by Todd C. Harris.</p> <p>Class Preparation and Prerequisites:</p> <p>Familiarity with HTML and CSS is assumed for this class - you don't need to be an expert, but an understanding of tags, attributes and how they interact with CSS are needed to fully participate.

Battle these adversaries with novel ways to identify and prioritize technical debt, based on behavioral data from how developers work with code. And that’s just for starters. Because good code involves social design, as well as technical design, you can find surprising dependencies between people and code to resolve coordination bottlenecks among teams. Best of all, the techniques build on behavioral data that you already have: your version-control system. Join the fight for better code!</i></p> ","visibility":"public"}]
